# Getting Sequence IDs
In order to get sequence IDs, you first need to compile the ``gs_sound_data.sarc`` by running ``makesound.bat``.

Once you've done that, you can open ``sound_list.html`` in any web browser to get the tables with sound IDs next to them. In order to search for a specific track, press ``CTRL+F`` and type in the filename, e.g. ``SEQ_GS_E_DENDOUIRI``, and the internal sdat ID will be positioned on the left.
